# Online Therapy Website – Final Project (MTM6201 Web Development II)

## Overview

This project is a fully responsive online therapy website built using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework. The goal was to turn our high-fidelity wireframes from the UX Design course into a working website. The website includes multiple pages such as Home, Services, Sign Up, Contact, and About. It is designed to be user-friendly, accessible, and responsive across all screen sizes.

## My Process

I started by organizing the project folder and setting up the basic structure, including the HTML files, CSS files, and images. I used the mockup I created during my UX course as the main reference and followed it while building the layout with Bootstrap. I made sure to use semantic HTML tags and structured everything so that it's clean and easy to understand.

Once the layout was in place, I moved on to customizing Bootstrap using CSS variables to match the color scheme of my design. I also created reusable sections like the navigation bar and footer to keep consistency across all pages.

## Challenges I Faced

The main challenge for me was keeping everything responsive and consistent while also sticking closely to the mockup. Some components in Bootstrap didn’t match my design exactly, so I had to adjust them with custom CSS, which took a bit of trial and error.

Another issue I faced was working with the `<picture>` tag and responsive images. I had to research a bit to make sure the images were optimized and used correctly with `srcset` and media queries. It took some testing to get that part working smoothly.

Lastly, making sure the site passed accessibility checks and looked good on smaller screens was a bit tricky. I used skip links, added `aria` labels, and tested keyboard navigation to improve usability.

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand how important it is to plan a structure before coding. I learned how to properly use Bootstrap while also overriding styles with my own CSS. It also gave me more experience working with media queries, form validation, and improving site accessibility.

I also learned a lot about publishing to GitHub Pages and how to make sure everything is working properly online—not just on my local machine.

## Technologies & Tools Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Assets

All text and code in this project was written by me. The images used are either self-created or from royalty-free sources. If any stock images were used, they are properly resized and placed in the `/images` folder.

## Final Thoughts

This project gave me a better understanding of front-end development and how to convert design files into working websites. I feel more confident using Bootstrap and working with responsive design. I also see areas I can improve in the future, like adding more interactivity with JavaScript or using Sass for more advanced CSS structure.
